# Dive Into Source

A stupid simple, powerful source code analyzer, targeting help you understand repo source code as quickly as possible.

Most important, it's beautiful.

## Features

### Basic

1. Count lines of code, total files, and ranking of folders based on including lines of code.

See [Benchmark](#benchmark) for the performance compared to other similar tools.


### Advanced

1. Generate calling-link between all functions or methods
2. Generate data objects


### Ultimate

1. Parse repo git data.
2. Full-text fuzzy search in code.


## Why the project?

Motivated by [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc), a tool to count lines of code of a repo.

Being a software & hardware engineer, most of our carrer time will spend on reading source code of others, maby be 80 percent or 90 percent.

When i view linux kernel source code, it's too hard to understand kernel which has more than 18 million lines of code.

so i searched with google, willing to find a better tool to help me. sadly, existing tools either bad or just expensive,

besides, all of them have bad UI and very complex.

that's why dive-into-source came out!


## How i built it?

## Design Features

1. Fully extensible. you can write your own language to be accepted by dive-into-source. Besides, you can even write your own analyze feature.



## Getting Started

### Concepts:

1. dive-into-source: All in one library to start with the project
2. dive-into-source-engine: The engine library to analyze source code
3. dive-into-source-visual: The default visual website to render generated data by engine
